Project: SnapYLE

SnapYLE is a Python-based news scraper designed and developed to automate daily news extraction from YLE News. It fetches headlines, short descriptions, and links in English and compiles them into a well-structured PDF report. This project offers a snappy and efficient way to stay updated with the latest news, all in one neatly organized document.
